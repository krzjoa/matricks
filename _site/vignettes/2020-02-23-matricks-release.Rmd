`matricks` package in **0.8.2** version has been released on CRAN! In this post I will present you, what are advantagese of using `matricks` and how you can use it.

### Creating matrices
The main function the package started with is `m`. It's a smart shortcut for creating matrices, especially usefull if you want to define a matrix by enumerating all the elements row-by-row. Typically, if you want to create a matrix in R, you can do it using `base` function called `matrix`.

```{r base.matrix}
matrix(c(3 ,4, 7,
         5, 8, 0,
         9, 2, 1), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
```
Although it's a very simple opeartion, the funtion call doesn't look tidy. Alternaively, we can use `tibble` with its `frame_matrix` function, defining column names with formulae first.

```{r tibble}
library(tibble)
frame_matrix(~ c1, ~ c2, ~ c3,
                3,    4,    7,
                5,    8,    0,
                9,    2,    1)
```
However, it's still not a such powerfull tool as `matricks::m` function is. Let's see an example.

```{r matricks.m}
library(matricks)
m(3 ,4, 7|
  5, 8, 0|
  9, 2, 1)
```
As simple as that! We join following rows using `|` operator. `m` function is very flexible and offers you much more than before mentioned ones. 
```{r matricks.vectors}
m(1:3 | 4, 6, 7 | 2, 1, 4)
```

And here and example with bindig multiple matrices together:
```{r matricks.binding}
mat1   <- diag(1, 3, 3)
mat2  <- antidiag(1, 3, 3) * 3
m(mat1, mat2|
  mat2, mat1)
```
By the way, `antidiag` function can be found in the `matricks` package too.

### Setting & accessing values
These code 
```{r setting.matrix}
mat <- matrix(0, 3, 3)
mat[1, 2] <- 0.3
mat[2, 3] <- 7
mat[3, 1] <- 13
mat[2, 2] <- 0.5
mat
```
can be replaced with:
```{r matricks.sv}
mat <- matrix(0, 3, 3)
mat <- set_values(mat,
                  c(1, 2) ~ 0.3,
                  c(2, 3) ~ 7,
                  c(3, 1) ~ 13,
                  c(2, 2) ~ 0.5)
mat
```

In some cases, traditional way we access a matrix element in `R` may be inconvenient. Consider situation shown below:
```{r matrix.loop}
sample.matrix <- matrix(1, 3, 3)
matrix.indices <- list(c(1, 1), c(1, 2), 
                       c(1, 3), c(2, 2),
                       c(3, 1), c(3, 3))

for (idx in matrix.indices) {
  sample.matrix[idx[1], idx[2]] <- sample.matrix[idx[1], idx[2]] + 2
}

sample.matrix
```

It can be expressed conciser using matrix `at` function.

```{r matrix.loop.at}
sample.matrix <- matrix(1, 3, 3)
matrix.indices <- list(c(1, 1), c(1, 2), 
                       c(1, 3), c(2, 2),
                       c(3, 1), c(3, 3))

for (idx in matrix.indices) {
  at(sample.matrix, idx) <- at(sample.matrix, idx) + 2
}
sample.matrix
```

### Plotting matrix
`matrix` objects haven't had good automatized plotting function until now. 
Let's create and plot a sample matrix of random values.

```{r matricks.runifm}
rmat <- runifm(3, 3)
print(rmat)
plot(rmat)
```

And here the same using a matrix of random boolean values (`rboolm`).

```{r matricks.rboolm}
set.seed(7)
rmat <- rboolm(3, 3)
print(rmat)
plot(rmat)
```

### Operators

`matricks` contains a family of operators, which allows you to perform column-/row-wise operation (addition/subtraction/multiplication/division) between matrix and vector.

```{r operators}
mat <- m(1, 2, 3|
         4, 5, 6|
         7, 8, 9)
mat
vec <- v(1:3)
vec
```
If we try to do a column-wise multiplication, we ecounter a problem.

```{r operators.error, error=TRUE}
mat * vec
```

We can bypass this error using `%m%` function. It does what we want!

```{r operator.example}
mat %m% vec
```

There are also several other operators available.

```{r other.operators}
mat %d% vec
mat %+% vec
mat %-% vec
```

I encourage you to familiarize with `matricks`. Visit [matrix documentation](https://krzjoa.github.io/matricks) site and learn more!
